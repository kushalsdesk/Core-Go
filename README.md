**Progress:** 🟩🟩⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜⬜

**1. Fundamentals:**  ✅

- Data Types 
    * ✔️Primitive types (nint, float64, string, bool) 
    * ✔Composite types (arrays, slices, maps, structs) 
- Variables & Operators 
    * ✔️Declaring and initializing variables
    * ✔️Arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators 
* Control Flow 
    * ✔️`if`, `else`, `elsif`, `switch` statements for conditional branching 
    * ✔️`while`, `for` loops for iteration 
* Functions 
    * ✔️Defining and invoking methods 
    * ✔️Parameters, return values, method overloading 
    * ✔️Funciton scope & visibility
* Packages & Imports 
    * ✔️Organize Code into packages
    * ✔️Importing and using packages
* Input & Output(I/O)
    * ✔️With `bufio`,`os` packages
    * ✔️With `Scanln`, Formatting with `Scanf`


**2. Strings: ✅**
* ✔️️Declaring and initializing strings
* ✔️️Concatenation and Formatting
* ✔️Essential methods for manipulation (e.g., `length`, `capacity`, `compare`, etc.) 
* ✔️Understanding that strings are immutable; creating new instances for modifications 

**3. Data Structures:** (✅)

* Arrays & Slices (✅)
    * ✔️️Declaring and creating arrays
    * ✔️️Slices: Dynamically sized views on arrays 
    * ✔️️Accessing and modifying elements 
    * ✔️️Iterating over elements 
    * ✔️️Common array/slice operations (append, copy, sort)
* Maps (❇)
    * Declaring and creating maps 
    * Accessing and modifying key-value pairs
    * Iterating over key-value pairs 
    * Deleting elements 
    * Common map operations (len, make, delete) 
* Pointers 
    * Understanding memory addresses and pointers 
    * Dereferencing pointers 
    * Passing pointers to functions
    * Pointer arithmetic 
    * Common pointer pitfalls and dangers 
* #####  Structures / Methods (❇) 
    * ✔️Defining and creating structures 
    * ✔️Method Format, Types by `Receiver` 
    * ✔️Accessing and modifying struct fields 
    * Embedding and composition 
    * Pointers to structures 

**4. Advanced Functions:❇**

* ✔️️Variadic functions
* Anonymous functions
* Defer statements
* Recursion

**5. Error Handling:❌**

* Understanding errors and error handling
* Returning errors from functions
* Using `error` interface
* Panic and recover

**6. Interfaces:❌**

* Defining and implementing interfaces
* Implicit and explicit interface implementation
* Interface values and type assertions

**7. Concurrency:❌**

* Understanding concurrency and goroutines
* Launching and managing goroutines
* Channels for communication
* WaitGroups for synchronization
* Mutexes and Semaphores


**8. Modules & Package Management:❌**

* Using Go modules for dependency management
* Understanding module versioning and resolution
* Building and publishing modules

**🔭 Web Development:**

- Web frameworks 
    * ❤Gin 
    * Gorilla
    * Echo
* Building basic web applications with Golang
* HTTP request handling and routing
